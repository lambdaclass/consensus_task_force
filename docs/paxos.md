# Paxos

## Introduction

The [original Paxos paper](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/lamport-paxos.pdf) explains multiple versions of a single-value consensus protocol called "Single-Decree Synod protocol" (commonly known as _Paxos_), following along with proofs and a story about the fictional island of Paxos ([not this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos)).
It later builds upon it to achieve consensus on a ledger.
This last version of the protocol is called "Paxos Parliament's protocol" by the paper, but is commonly known as _Multi-Paxos_.

Here, I'll try to summarize both protocols.
